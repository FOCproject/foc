Not suggested atm - the pip package is not well defined, better to simply run console_run.py, see the README.md file.

Open a terminal, point it at this path and issue:

sudo python setup.py install

An alternative is to go to the dist folder and issue:

sudo easy_install FOCForecaster-0.1-py2.7.egg
